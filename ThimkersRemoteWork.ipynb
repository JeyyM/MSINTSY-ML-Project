    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "Remote and highly flexible work arrangements have become increasingly coveted among software developers, offering benefits such as improved work-life balance, location flexibility, and expanded employment opportunities even including other countries. However, as remote roles grow more competitive, many job seekers lack clear, data-driven insights into the characteristics commonly associated with such positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project applies supervised machine learning classification techniques to the Stack Overflow 2025 Developer Survey to predict whether a developer works in a remote or highly flexible work arrangement based on demographic, professional, and job-related features. By modeling patterns present in real-world survey data, the study aims to identify factors that are strongly predictive of remote or flexible work status.\n",

    "**Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses data from the Stack Overflow 2025 Developer Survey, a large-scale, annual survey conducted among software developers worldwide. The survey collects self-reported information on demographics, education, employment status, work arrangements, technologies used, and professional experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**survey_results_public.csv**\n",
    "\n",
    "This file contains all of the survey responses, where each row represents a single respondent. Columns correspond to survey questions covering topics such as employment characteristics, work environment, developer role, experience level, education background, and technology usage. Responses include a mix of numerical values, categorical selections, and multi-select answers. This file serves as the main source of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**survey_results_schema.csv**\n",
    "\n",
    "This file provides the metadata and schema for the multiple select questions within the survey.\n",

    "**Why This Is a Real-World Dataset and Relevant to the Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Stack Overflow Developer Survey is a real-world dataset collected annually from a large and diverse population of developers. The data reflects self-reported information about respondents' actual employment conditions, work environments, and professional backgrounds, rather than synthetic or simulated data. As a result, the dataset captures real labor market conditions and work arrangements experienced by developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is directly relevant to the problem of predicting remote and flexible work arrangements because it explicitly includes questions about respondents' current work situations, including whether they work remotely, in person, or under flexible arrangements. Additionally, the survey contains a wide range of demographic, professional, and organizational variables. Such as role type, years of experience, education level, company characteristics, and more that can plausibly relate to work arrangement outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because remote work has become increasingly competitive and sought after in the software industry, understanding which characteristics are predictive of remote or highly flexible roles is a socially and professionally relevant task applicable to job seekers and recruiters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem Definition and Machine Learning Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we build a supervised machine learning model that predicts whether a developer is employed in a remote or highly flexible work arrangement based on their professional background, using the Stack Overflow 2025 Developer Survey?\n",

    "### **Scope and Inclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the analysis focuses exclusively on respondents' current professional situation as captured by the Stack Overflow 2025 Developer Survey. To ensure that the predictive task reflects present-day employment conditions rather than future intentions or subjective opinions, only variables describing respondents' existing work arrangement, professional background, industry, experience, and current technology usage are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the study excludes variables that relate to future interests such as technologies respondents wish to work with in the coming year, as these do not describe their current employment situation. Preference-based and opinion-oriented responses such as personal rankings, preferences, and thoughts regarding AI will be omitted due to their subjective nature and limited relevance to predicting present work situations. Additionally, write-in \"Other\" custom text fields are excluded in favor of standardized response options provided by the surveyors to maintain consistency and reduce noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature set is further restricted to general industry and professional characteristics which means that questions related to Stack Overflow community engagement are excluded, as these reflect community interaction rather than employment conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scoped feature selection allows the model to focus on stable, interpretable characteristics that might plausibly relate to a developer's current work arrangement, while avoiding future-oriented thoughts, subjective preferences, and community-specific behaviors that fall outside the objective of the model.\n",

    "### **Survey Coverage**\n",
    "\n",
    "To efficiently explore, clean, and prepare the features for modeling, the dataset is processed section by section, following the order and structure of the Stack Overflow 2025 Developer Survey. This approach allows each group of related variables to be examined, cleaned, and transformed independently before being integrated before being used for training. For each section, missing values are identified and handled, categorical variables are standardized and encoded as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections of the survey are included in the analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Education + Career**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section contains variables describing respondents' demographic background and current professional status. Included features capture education level, years of experience, job role, and **current work arrangement**. These variables provide a foundational profile of a developer's career stage and work context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tech and Tech Culture**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section includes respondents' current technology usage in professional settings. Variables indicate whether respondents actively worked with programming languages, database systems, web frameworks, and other tools in the past year. Only features reflecting technologies already used are included. Questions describing technologies respondents wish to use in the future or custom write-ins are excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AI + AI Agents**\n",
    "\n",
    "From the AI-related section, only variables describing current AI tool and AI agent usage are included. These features capture whether respondents presently use AI tools and agents as part of their work. Subjective variables such as opinions about AI, trust levels, or frustrations are excluded since they reflect subjective beliefs.\n",
